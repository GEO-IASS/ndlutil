ReadMe file for the NDLUTIL toolbox version 0.11 Thursday, June 17, 2004 at 15:59:43
Written by Neil D. Lawrence.

This toolbox implements some generic functions used by other toolboxes. Originally it was spun out of the IVM 0.221 toolbox.

cumGaussian.m: Cumulative distribution for Gaussian.
gaussOverDiffCumGaussian.m: A gaussian in x over the difference between two cumulative Gaussians. 
gradLogCumGaussian.m: Gradient of the log of the cumulative Gaussian.
invCumGaussian.m: Inverser of the cumulative Gaussian.
invSigmoid.m: The inverse of the sigmoid function.
lnCumGaussian.m: log cumulative distribution for Gaussian.
logdet.m: The log of the determinant when argument is positive definite.
ngaussian.m: Compute a Gaussian with mean 0 and variance 1.
pdinv.m: Computes the inverse of a positive definite matrix.
preparePlot.m: Helper function for tidying up the plot before printing.
rocCurve.m: Draw ROC curve and return labels.
sigmoid.m: The sigmoid function
