{"name":"ndlutil","tagline":"General utilities for MATLAB.","body":"Matlab Ndlutil Toolbox\r\n======================\r\n\r\nRelease Information\r\n-------------------\r\n\r\n**Current release is 0.163**. Added plotMatrix for visualizating matrices on figure axes.\r\n\r\n#### Version 0.162\r\n\r\nAdded files for printing to latex plots from Octave.\r\n\r\n#### Version 0.161\r\n\r\nUpdates by Antti to lnDiffErf. Added readBinaryDoubles and printPlot.\r\n\r\n#### Version 0.16\r\n\r\nRelease for ICML tutorial. Added cumGamma and gammaPdf. Also added isoctave and several matlab helper files for reading from file IDs.\r\n\r\n#### Version 0.159\r\n\r\nMinor release for dimensional reduction demos. Added centeringMatrix.m.\r\n\r\n#### Version 0.158\r\n\r\nAntti Honkela provided the files lnDiffErfs and gradLnDiffErfs to assist in computing the DISIM kernel from the kernel toolbox stably.\r\n\r\n#### Version 0.157\r\n\r\nAdded treeFindLeaves.\r\n\r\nVersion 0.156\r\nMoved treeFindParents, treeFindChildren and treeSwapNode into this toolbox from MOCAP toolbox.\r\n\r\n#### Version 0.155\r\n\r\nMoved lnCumGaussSum from NCNM toolbox to this toolbox as part of merge of NCNM toolbox into NOISE and IVM toolboxes.\r\n\r\n#### Version 0.154\r\n\r\nAdded code for checking Hessian matrices.\r\n\r\n#### Version 0.153\r\n\r\nAdded comments to files and changed jitChol, pdinv and logdet so that they can return any jitter added. If the return the jitter then they don't emit a warning.\r\n\r\n#### Version 0.152\r\n\r\nThere was a sign error in lnDiffCumGaussian. This has been fixed. The sign error was replicated in the NOISE and PRIOR toolboxes (a case of two wrongs making a 'right'). This means that earlier versions of this toolbox are incompatible with versions of PRIOR before 0.131 and versions of NOISE before 0.131.\r\n\r\n#### Version 0.151\r\n\r\nSped up the sparseDiag command using spdiag, this makes the FGPLVM code run much faster.\r\n\r\n#### Version 0.15\r\n\r\nFixed inconsistencies in logdet and pdinv and corrected the amount of jitter that is added at first try. Placed the jitter addition in a new file jitChol which is called by both functions.\r\n\r\nAdded kldivGaussian for computing Gaussian Kullback-Leibler divergences.\r\n\r\nAdded deg2rad for converting degrees to radians.\r\n\r\n#### Version 0.142\r\n\r\nAdded sparseDiag and moved data loading methods into the new DATASETS toolbox.\r\n\r\n#### Version 0.14\r\n\r\nMoved in lvmLoadData and mappingLoadData as generic methods of loading in data sets.\r\n\r\n#### Version 0.131\r\n\r\nAdded files getline.m and tokenise.m which are string utilities for reading and processing files.\r\n\r\n#### Version 0.13\r\n\r\npdinv now adds jitter which is proportional to the mean of the diagonal elements of the matrix.\r\n\r\nPage updated on Sun Jun 17 08:11:07 2012\r\n","google":"UA-62968536-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
